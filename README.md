#storygen

With this simple program you can generate a short story that contains: fake name, language, place of birth and death, cause of death, bookname and personal details. THEY ARE NOT REAL!

Run this program with IDLE 3.0 or a newer version. The program will save the story and personal details of your character into a file named "story.txt" that you will find in the directory you have downloaded the python file.
